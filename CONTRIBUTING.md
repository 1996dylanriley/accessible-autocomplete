# Contributing

Contributions welcome, please raise a pull request.

To develop locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Contributions will need to pass the linter and tests. To run everything once:

```
npm test
```

To run the tests in dev mode (automatically reruns when a file changes):

```
npm run test:dev
```
