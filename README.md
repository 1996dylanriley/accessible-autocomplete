# Accessible Typeahead

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tvararu/typeahead.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/preact-boilerplate)

`accessible-typeahead` is a JavaScript typeahead built from the ground up to be accessible. The design goals are:

- **Accessibility**: Following WAI-ARIA best practices and testing with assistive technologies.
- **User experience**: Supporting a wide variety of browsers, devices, and user needs.
- **Compability**: It aims to be easy to integrate into existing services, and uses progressive enhancement. It comes in a zero dependency version that weighs `6.1kb` minified and gzipped.

## Installation

Coming soon.

## Usage

Coming soon.

## Why another typeahead?

`accessible-typeahead` was built after studying many existing solutions and prototyping patches to fix user experience or accessibility issues. It draws heavy inspiration from the following (and a lot of others):

- [ljwatson/design-patterns](http://ljwatson.github.io/design-patterns/autocomplete/index.html): great accessible experience
- [corejavascript/corejs-typeahead](https://github.com/corejavascript/typeahead.js): flexible typeahead/suggestion engine architecture
- [JamieAppleseed/selectToAutocomplete](https://github.com/JamieAppleseed/selectToAutocomplete): ease of use
